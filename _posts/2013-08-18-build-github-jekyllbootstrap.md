# 如何搭建 git github jekyllbootstrap markdownpad 来写自己的Blog #

**github** 开放、进取、共享。

## github ##
1、Get an account：

[http://github.com](http://github.com/ "github.com")

创建后的 account name 就是 你的 USERNAME。

2、Create a New Repository

Go to your https://github.com and create a new repository named USERNAME.github.com

注意，无论前面自己建了几个仓库，必须要新建一个与自己的USERNAME相同的，并且要有 .github.com 后缀的 仓库名。
如，dunty.github.com，否则后继的提交总会失败，因为不存在jekyllbootstrap需要仓库！！

3、下载安装 github for windows

[github for windows guide](https://help.github.com/articles/getting-started-with-github-for-windows "windows")
Getting Started with GitHub for Windows

GitHub for Windows was designed from the ground-up to not only be the best GitHub client available, but the best git client, period. It makes heavy use of Windows' sexy Metro look. Everything looks, acts, and feels like a native Windows program.

To get started, download the latest version directly from [windows.github.com](http://windwos.github.com/ "").

GitHub for Windows sign in screenWhen you start the app, you'll be given the option to either log into your GitHub account, or create a new one.
